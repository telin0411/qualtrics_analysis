MCQ Goal: How to clean your computer keyboard keys?
MCQ Sol1: Keeping the computer keys clean can extend the life of your lap top or desk top. If you don't clean the keys, the symbols can eventually become hard to read and you may find you are making many silly typing errors, just because you cannot read the keys. Spray the corner of a rag with windex, or vinegar, and wipe carefully until you can see the symbols clearly again. If the symbols have worn completely away, you can paint them on again with nail polish.
MCQ SOl2: You can get tiny letter stickers that just stick on the computer keys, and you may never have to bother again with windex or vinegar. The F keys are usually tricky, as they are so small, however you can place or tape a cardboard sign above these ones, that indicates what each one should be.
