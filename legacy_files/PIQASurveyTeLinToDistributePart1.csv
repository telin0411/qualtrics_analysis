Also the language ""to make sure those little bits don't ever get out"" sounded a little informal, infantile perhaps. Finally, I understood ""maracas"" but it's possible that many people wouldn't, since it is specific to a culture. ",I'm not sure what 'chalk paint' is.,"I think perhaps the word ""the"" before ""paper"" made me wonder if there were a specific paper the question was referring to (typically in English we would not use ""the"" if speaking generally, of any paper...)","The colander option didn't *not* make sense, but, given that the question was how to get water out of a coconut, technically I guess either answer could have been true - both described how to get the water out, although only one described how to catch it/keep it/contain it afterwards.  But even with a colander, you would have still gotten the water and performed the task in question. Also I think that perhaps not everyone has had experience getting water out of a coconut, so this might be based on culture (location, or, family culture/what groceries families buy and bring home).","""to a professional result"" sounded a little strange to me; ""for a professional result""?  Also, I'm not sure most people would put tape around their nails before painting, but the part about the Q-tip dipped in nail polish remover follows normally.  But I still chose that one because the other completely seemed wrong, since I've never seen anyone use ""flesh colored"" nail polish to paint over mistakes on the skin!",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"the only thing underspecified is whether or not the pen mentioned is possibly an erasable pen (if they even still make those). Otherwise, pencil would be the undisputed choice. ","Between the two choices, pencil tip made the most sense.  However, most people would use a metal or wooden nail tool, as use of a pencil would be 1) gross and 2) would probably leave grey marks so it wouldn't actually achieve the effect of removing debris/cleaning, but rather would add more debris.","While a heating pad can work for aches and pains, I couldn't be sure if it would *always* alleviate stomach pain. Perhaps it depends on the reason for the stomach pain.  And I couldn't be sure about the modifier ""quickly"", either.",N/A,N/A,"I can't remember how to make papier mâché, but I think the second one makes more sense.  The underspecified selection is because i think some information is missing: I think you must add water, or something else to turn the paper bits into a gooey liquid.","Certainly the colander option makes no sense because the cream would run through it, but, it's underspecified because why would you prepare plain heavy cream for baking (by itself)?","The fruits part makes sense, but it seems there is more to a balanced diet than only fruit.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Typical Functions: What is its main purpose or typical use? e.g. Paper towels can be used to clean up the table.
