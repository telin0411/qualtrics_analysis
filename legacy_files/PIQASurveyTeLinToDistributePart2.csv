(which would help me know if the materials were correct) and also, what the curtain would be made of - vinyl records only?  I was imagining there would need to be some sort of fabric vinyle or other fabric material to make the background/attachment for the records. Also it doesn't make a lot of sense why one would use vinyl records to make a curtain, but I suppose this is some people's design preference. Finally, I didn't understand the wooden plank cut to the size of the door frame, unless of course this is  wooden ""curtain"", as I think in some cultures ""curtains"" can be wooden...I tend to think of fabric/soft/malleable when I think ""curtain""...",n/a,n/a,"how would you use a TV to accomplish this? It was underspecified.  Also, not all actors are trained in magic tricks, so I can't be sure of that answer either.","I didn't know what a Hawaiian Burger Bacon Ball was - I know what a burger is, but if it were shaped in a ball it would no longer seem to be a burger because it couldn't sit in a bun.","Neither the question nor answer made sense to me, nor was I familiar with the following words/phrases: mounting pole, hose reel, top swivel bushing mount, bushing centerline, lag bolts, bottom bushing, masonry bolts (although for this last, I imagine it's some sort of bolt that can hold a concrete substance together).",n/a,"although a mouth can indeed be used to provide audio, the word choice was strange - it would have made more sense if the mouth provided ""narration"" since audio technically isn't speech...also it's not really the mouth that provides it (or at least, not only the mouth making the ""audio""), but rather the person and brain behind the physical mouth. And just all taken together, this didn;t make a lot of sense, but I do think a 10yo would agree that a ""mouth"" can speak for ""audio"".  Also, ""privide"" was confusing, but I'm guessing this meant ""provide.""","I'm guessing this means a ""spit"" like a large skewer/brochette...but it wouldn't really be *that* which cooks the entire pig, but rather the entire set-up including the heat/fire, like the phrase ""spit-fire grill.""  So the answer seemed incomplete/underspecified to me.","I'm not sure this is an actual SOS method, however, I do think the flash (if it were sunny) could indeed get the attention of a plane.   In addition, it was ambiguous, to read ""to reflect off planes in distance""  to me ""planes in [the] distance"" seemed to be one phrase that went together, but that's not what you'd be ""relfect[ing] off [of]"" - it would instead be, ""to reflect off of [or better, "" to reflect sunlight""] to signal planes in the distance""",n/a,"I felt that because I didn't know the items, I couldn't be sure if it were actually a hiking *kit* - a hiking kit would require specific things, and I couldn't be sure if the ""small items"" would have included those things.  Also, storing them in an empty soup can didn't make a lot of sense - maybe a bear can or something else more sealed, or, a container you could actually functionally use once hiking ( a camping soup *pan* for instance) since you want to minimize the amount of unnecessary objects to reduce pack weight. ","this is assuming that the bag already has a sewn ""tube"" through which to thread the rope","This makes sense, I had just never heard of this method.  I use Goo Gone.","I'm not sure people would ""waste"" perfume for this purpose since it's more costly than other more-common sense alternatives like home air fresheners (like Glade) or even febreeze or other odor-neutralizers. Also ""scented bags"" would have made more sense than ""bags that smell fresh."" but yes just taking the answer at face value, perfume indeed would make it smell better.

I've always known a float as ice cream floating in some kind of liquid.",n/a,"I can't be sure about the ""soaking"" part - if so, it seemed underspecified, because I think you would need to *drain* the rice before microwaving it, not go straight from soaking to putting in the microwave to heat.  On my end, I've always added a very tiny amount of water and stirred the rice, or, have just ""sprinkled"" the rice with water...I have never ""soaked"" it.",n/a,"I understood all of the words, just not how they all fit together in a meaningful way, nor the purpose of the prompt/activity.",n/a,n/a,n/a,"The response using the end of the hammer made more sense since you're trying to get the nails out, but I didn't understand the ""log"" part...perhaps this is a part of a pallet and I'm just unfamiliar with this use of the word ""log.""",n/a,Typical Functions: What is its main purpose or typical use? e.g. Paper towels can be used to clean up the table.
